    Dune: Part Two

<div>
<h4>Dune: Part Two</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    With the considerable ratings upgrade from Part One, I definitely went into this one expecting a lot. I was a huge fan of the first one. I was on board for it to be the start of my generation's Star Wars. I'll say fairly that Part Two disappointed me, but it wasn't bad. After considerable deliberation I have to put Part One above Part Two as far as my own preference goes, so Part Two was plenty good enough to challenge Part One. Part Two was slower, creepier, and more ominous. That's obviously wholly my own made-up comparison, but I just didn't feel like the books were as creepy as the movies are, Part Two especially. Part Two had two fantastic fight scenes, an incredible CGI arena, a cast more stellar than the first performing at their best, and a plot that marched along like an army, steadily and relentlessly. I liked the interactions between characters (most of them at least) more in the first, and I liked a lot more scenes by themselves. However, Part Two's Brolin was fantastic for every minute on screen, Butler's role was not an easy one to pull off (but he did), and Bardem was jaw-droppingly amazing with his fanaticism and prophesying. But most of all, Zendaya and Chalamet's relationship was done really well. It provided a really cool desert oasis in the midst of the chaos and creepiness, and definitely pulled smiles. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about with Zendaya towards the end, but their sweetness to each other in their tent and elsewhere really added value to the movie. And yes, Chalamet's sandworm-riding scene was amazing.

<h4>Wonka</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    My wife's a huge fan of the Johnny Depp Wonka, so she watched this one cautiously. "Don't you dare ruin my childhood", etc. She liked it very much. I personally appreciated the humor and the visuals, but this movie didn't really do it for me. I dislike with a passion the "A Series of Unfortunate Events" -style constant-obstacles fictional storyline. As in, the incessant trouble Chalamet (who did a fantastic job) runs into. From the "fine print" to the "chocolate cartel", it just makes me frustrated; feeling like the story can never actually make any progress. I would enjoy more a movie where stuff goes right. I know this style is appreciated by many, and I think it's true to Roald Dahl if I remember correctly what of his I've read, but it just unsettles me. So I struggle to give a fair verdict. The style rubs me the wrong way, and makes me feel like the story's lazily-written and blandly irritating. On the other hand, I'm sure that my entire opinion on that point is personal preference. So to make a judgment on the rest of the movie, the musicality, sets, color, eccentricity, performances, and humor were all great. Matt Lucas, Rowan Atkinson (whom I deeply adore), and Keegan-Michael Key all got me laughing. Watch it, I very much doubt you'll regret it.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Marvels</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    So, it turns out that the Marvel fanbase is generally incredibly sexist. Maybe its a reaction to feeling like feminism is being shoved down their throats at every turn, but whatever the cause, I went into The Marvels with incredibly low expectations. The casting? Bad. The acting? Bad. The plot? Bad. The CGI? Bad. The jokes? Bad. I could go on. I was expecting preachy girl power, essentially, or Barbie dressed up like a superhero. Ah, but they were all wrong. One's ability of self-persuasion and voluntary blindness to validate such a misogynistic viewpoint of this movie must be fantastic. Anyway. The plot held together well compared to some recent Marvels. As you may know, I do not consider myself a part of that idiot bandwagon called "everything Marvel makes since Endgame is trash". I don't really get why people tell themselves that. Without going into too much detail, Shang-Chi was one of my favorite Marvel movies overall and I thought the second Black Panther might have been better than the first. Again, anyway. Aside from the pretty solid plot, the movie was super goofy. I laughed at it a bunch of times. More-guy-oriented humor alone, I laughed at Fury and Kamala's dad and brother. So much of the interaction between the three Marvels was really cool and heartwarming. The way Captain Rambeau's abilities were shown on screen were awesome. The space elevator was awesome. The singing planet was a fascinatingly-deep alternate-culture dive for a Marvel movie. To conclude this uncharacteristically long review, which I confess is the result of frustration with the naysayers, The Marvels was great and I applaud the people involved for making a movie with three female leads that I can really get behind and enjoy.

<h4>Wish</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm incredibly disappointed to have to rank this movie so low on my list for the year, but it can't be avoided. Too many good movies this year I think. I have a couple reasons why it wasn't really very good. None of them make it a bad movie, and children might enjoy it a whole lot. One, this movie has some odd jokes and interactions that just seem strange. I feel it's a recent trend, taken to the exstreme by the blatantly sexual jokes in Trolls 3. Two, the plot was really just sad and scary for most of the movie. That's the biggest problem with it. The fun start was very very short, the fun ending was very very short, lots of evil sorcery and doom for the middle hour. It didn't make for a super enjoyable movie. Three is a really interesting point. This movie blended 2D and 3D animation in a really weird way. I didn't know anything about this before I saw it, but within 30 seconds I could tell something was off and I had figured it out. So it is significant, and I have a small TV. What the movie did was primarily use 2D-drawn backgrounds but 3D foregrounds / moving items. This makes the movie look animatedly rear-projected. It's really odd. I'm assuming this was done for the very real benefit of super-high detail in all the backgrounds, enabled by the fact that they're 2D, but it did not look smooth. It looked like a play with a backdrop at times because of how stark the contrast was. I don't know. It was weird. But I doubt kids will notice.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Migration</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The trailers got me on this one. I was hoping for a movie comparable to Minions, but I was a little disappointed. The humor didn't appeal to me often as an adult, and the storyline and animation were pretty normal. As far as for kids, I'm sure it'll be enjoyed by many. I'm sure my little brothers will think this movie's a lot of fun, and I'm sure parents appreciate the short runtime. So nothing against the movie itself as kids' animation, I'm just disappointed that it wasn't Despicable Me or any other modern animations that appeal to adult watchers as much as to their children. Those movies are the distinction between the "kids" genre and the "family" genre.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Leo</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    My wife and I watched this together because we're both huge Adam Sandler fans and are young enough to not be miserable with some decent-quality kid animation. I was even more pleased with this movie than I expected to be, and it's definitely something my little brothers need to watch. It's incredibly funny, it's incredibly heartwarming, the storyline is such a good one, all the characters are so loveable, and it has such a soft and safe feel. Even just a few minutes in, I knew it was going to be good. But it continued to get better and better as it went on. There's not really much else to say. If you're under 16, I'm sure you'll love this movie. If you're 16 or older, it's still quality and entertaining.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Trolls Band Together</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I liked the first Trolls movie a lot. I mean, I was bored during the singing, which was a lot of the movie, but the rest I enjoyed. The animation and plot were great and it was a fun kid movie. The second I was less happy with. It felt more odd than anything else, and the glittery adult-baby was a source of discomfort to me. Unfortunately, glittery adult-baby returned for the third, along with many other characters spouting ridiculously inappropriate lines for a movie intended for children. I mean, "I'll grab my butt marker"? And, "I didn't think both of us would be tied up on this honeymoon"? Both probably not verbatim quotes. But these two statements were out of dozens. I think disgusted is too strong of a word, but I would not permit any children under my care to watch this movie.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Next Goal Wins</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    If you watched Champions, this movie is almost identical, but replace the special needs kids with goofy American Samoans and add some Taika Waititi. It was a joy to watch. Fassbender played his role to the fullest, but the attention was directed towards the American Samoan people, which is what I wanted to enjoy. Maybe I should move there someday. So the movie as a whole, great. Now for a caution/discussion about the prominent presence of a third-gender person in this movie. I did not immediately understand why Jaiyah was getting so much screen time and was so central to the movie. I assumed some slight activism, although it never got pushy. At the end of the movie you realize why it all makes sense for Fassbender and her to be so close, and you then understand why she was prominent. So in other words, if you're concerned, don't worry, it's not activism. But I'm going to go a little further on this subject. I think that simplifying Jaiyah to a trans person causes a lot of misconceptions by a Western audience. Her taking hormones supports that terminology to an extent, but it's important to understand that Jaiyah is very different from a trans person from the United States. American Samoa, along with many other cultures, traditionally have a third gender, and that's what Jaiyah is. So reducing her to a trans person feels inaccurate and misconceived, and carries with it Western implications that aren't necessarily true.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Wicked Little Letters</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Whatever this British cinematic style with quick-cutting shots and rapid dialogue is called, it's fun. Enola Holmes jumps to mind as a movie sharing those characteristics. I saw some criticism of its box-checking of diversity, feminism, aanti-Christianity, and whatever else, but I wasn't really bothered by any of it. I did question a little the reasonability of having a Black high court judge in the 1920s, so that was a little distracting whether my doubt was justified or not. Anyway, as far as the actual movie, it was certainly worth watching. It was quick, witty, goofy, and got heavy enough to draw some real sadness out of the viewer by the end. The storyline's difficult to discuss without spoiling anything, but I did find the idea of an oppressed religious individual needing a world outlet a little fascinating. Timothy Spall was downright marvelous. Nobody else disappointed. I think that anyone with an affinity for Britishness, mystery, and lighthearted humor, with a strong tolerance of somehow-mostly-innocent language, would enjoy this movie.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Dumb Money</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    So I was pretty critical of this movie before I saw it. I thought, how could Hollywood make a movie about the GameStop squeeze, and it not feel hypocritical? But it didn't. This movie was great. I wouldn't call myself an insider during the squeeze, but I was on r/wsb and following closely during the events. I would occasionally tune in to the live discussions and tell my dad what moves were being made. However, I did not invest at all myself. So from that perspective, I can say I was really happy with the movie's accuracy. The examples of r/wsb behavior were particularly accurate. I'm hesitant to applaud the accuracy to behaviors outside of basement-dwellers. How many sorority girls really took on an interest in the stock market and held into sextuple digits? From my time on r/wsb, I would have sworn it was almost all guys 20-40 doing the squeeze, nearly all knowledgeable, and not their first stock buys. But whatever. If there were some outliers and they used their existence to justify the added drama and impact of making nurses and students invest, fine. There are three big takeaways from this movie for me. One, Paul Dano was amazing. I am a huge fan of his and he was so perfect for this role. Two,  the size of the cast is incredible and really cool to see. Three, the vulgarity of what was really happening on r/wsb during that squeeze is portrayed throughout the movie, from the deafening soundtrack to the language and internet clips. That is simply amazing. That's really how it was on r/wsb during GameStop.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Killer</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is such a sad statement, but the best part of this movie in my opinion was the cool cover. I was just so disappointed. I like Michael Fassbender a lot and David Fincher can be relied upon, obviously. The Killer just didn't have any kick to me. It was so mellow and spent so much time with draggy inner monologue. I'm not entirely sure what the point of this movie was. Similarly to Nefarious, I think it should have just been a book. Why spend all the money on making this a movie? Everything happened so simply and slowly that it could have been a book of a really-nice length instead. Kind of like Bourne plus Crime and Punishment, maybe. It had a couple of scenes worth a screen, but otherwise it could have been left to the imagination. I tried really hard to like this movie and something just wasn't there for me.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Holdovers</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    In the words of my dad, in relation to this movie, which I also found true for myself: I went into this movie expecting a lot, and received even more. This movie might be the number one candidate for a Christmas-Eve-tradition watch. It had such a comforting holiday feel, such deep meaningful characters, and such dang good writing. It's an experience worth the entirety of one's attention, and especially once you know how it ends, it's one worth many rewatches. The cast impressed, not least Paul Giamatti, with actors I've never seen before putting on impressive performances. This movie felt like it got ten times the care and attention to detail that Oppenheimer or Killers of the Flower Moon got. It's truly a finished product, and beautiful.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Blue Beetle</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This was an interesting experience. On one hand, it really had no depth or value beyond fight scenes. On the other hand, I'm pretty confident it never intended or pretended to. It had a bare-necessities plotline, a pretty convincing villain, and some good moments. It has its flaws, as every superhero flick does, but this isn't really a movie to think about. It's no Spider-Man or Deadpool. It's two hours of a Spider-Man suit-equipped fight scene (like the one against Michael Keaton in Homecoming) if that piques your interest. It didn't mine, but no harm done. It was nice to see a superhero movie that tried to be simple and fun and did exactly that. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I haven't seen a minute of any old TMNT, so this review has to be based entirely off of just this one instance. I have to say that this movie was really great. I could tell that it was being nostalgic, even if I wasn't triggered, and the general feel of the movie is so lighthearted and goofy. Splinter is hilarious, the turtles' chats with each other are goofy, and it has a nice plot with a unique villain that never leads the story into real danger, allowing it to stay goofy all the way through. Goofy is the best word to describe this movie, from the style of the animation to the dialogue to the storyline to the characters themselves. I'm sure that this movie will kindle an interest in TMNT in many young'uns, and I'm sure many old'uns would enjoy watching alongside.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Gran Turismo</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This movie does hit a little close to home, because I've been addicted to racing since my first kart race at the age of eight. Similarly to the idea of the story, my family was never able to afford putting me in anything ranked, regardless of how good I was. I didn't start sim racing until a few years ago, and once I had saved up enough to get some entry tech for that, I struggled to find the time in a work and school schedule to commit to it. My family has always followed F1 closely, and that's the rest of my exposure. I can say that this movie was a joy to watch. As someone familiar with so much of the content, it felt so very realistic. There was only one deviation from that realism in my opinion, and that's the dirty racing so prevalent in a couple instances. I guess they added that for the drama, but it was sad to see because there was already so much drama available. I don't mean that nobody races dirty, but nobody at that level rams other drivers. That can be an instant loss of your privilege to compete. So that whole storyline with the on-track bullies was just exaggerated and unfitting to the realism of the rest of the movie. Aside from the realism, the soundtrack and cinematography had such a smooth feel. I was reminded of the style of Ford v Ferrari, or Creed. It's high-level cinema. The plot is a great one, it's such an added depth for it to follow a true story so closely, and the characters (especially David Harbour's) are so deep for what I expected to be a shallow racing movie. This really is a great slice of cinema.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Boy and the Heron</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm a dedicated fan of Studio Ghibli, and I was so happy to not be disappointed by this (alleged) last hurrah by Miyazaki. It is so special for it to be a project that Miyazaki was able to spend years on, and I would say that it's clear how much love and focus went into this film. Every shot is so intentional and beautiful in Studio Ghibli's way. That's not to say other Studio Ghibli movies aren't, but this film particularly stands out to me as being visually fantastic. The storyline was an alright one; I always feel that the storyline is more of an excuse for the characters and scenes in a Studio Ghibli film, with some exceptions like Grave of the Fireflies. If this is Miyazaki's last, it's a beautiful one.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Oppenheimer</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Oppenheimer was a really visually-striking piece of cinema. It also beats No Country for Old Men for the most suspenseful film scene I've ever seen. It was really cool to see the behind-the-scenes of the science behind the atomic bomb. Other than that, there's not actually much to say. It watched more like a plain biography than a film. I have to say that I was disappointed. My expectations were high, perhaps unreasonably so. The movie just never really pulled my emotions in, which is hard to believe considering the subject matter. The lack of a linear storyline also didn't feel like it added anything to the movie. It was a lot (three hours worth, fast-paced) to process, but I think all in all, it was beautiful cinematography and subwoofer usage, but I was very disappointed with most of the rest. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Barbie</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is a really hard review for me to write objectively. My feelings were hurt. I understand the point of the movie entirely. If women were truly as societally discriminated against as the movie claims, (I think) everything about the movie would be a valid call-out. But they're just not, plain and simple. I am sure that many women face discrimination every day. But that is not societal. Heck, one gets sued and burned to the ground at any hint of misogyny. Women won the women's rights movement, and I'm glad they did. But now the women's rights movement, which is unnecessary, has transitioned to a blatantly and brutally misandric movement. It's a now-it's-our-turn mentality, exactly as Barbie showed. I don't really know what else to say. The movie is absolute sexism in pretty pink. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Flash</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This was a fantastic movie. I think that it's my favorite superhero movie since Wakanda Forever. It had a great plot, something that's been nearly completely lacking in recent years; it made sense, something that DC has not been doing; it took its time and didn't rush through; it had a great soundtrack; it was funny; and it had No Way Home -level nostalgia with the returning Clooney and Keaton. I know it's been rated very poorly, but I heard rumors that it was better that those ratings, and it exceeded my expectations. Sure, it doesn't have some big Marvel-Phase-like overarching storyline, but I think it might be time for DC to quit with stuff like that and just make standalone good movies. The Batman was great, and so was this one.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Nimona</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I had heard from multiple sources that this movie has the best 2D animation since Disney in the 90s and 00s. I didn't hear as much about the storyline. I was disappointed in both. There was too much going on animation-wise; I greatly prefer the goofiness of the new Spider-Mans if the recipe has deviated from Hercules and The Princess and the Frog. The storyline felt as jumbled as the animation at times, and often the speed and lack of explanation with which it progressed was very detrimental to the movie. Also, it fails to feel unpreachy to have two guys kiss front and center about two minutes into a kids' movie.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    A worthy sequel, Across the Spider-Verse built on the fun of Into, never slowing down. It's difficult to say which I liked better, as I liked the slightly-more-goofy animation in the first one better than the animation in the sequel, but I think the storyline was a little better in this sequel. I do, however, get tired of the rebellion plot factor. For example: young Spider-Mans refusing to tell their loving parents who they are, refusing to believe the things their seniors tell them, etc. It's mildly exhausting to watch kids make bad decisions and their decisions be glorified and work out. But aside from that general common writing trend in many kids' movies, this movie was one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while, and lived up to all the expectations I had heard.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Elemental</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Elemental was a beautiful world to behold. While the storyline and characters weren't particularly noteable in my opinion, they certainly weren't a problem, and the viewer is distracted otherwise with the scale of, and attention to detail in, the created world on the screen. I can totally see it becoming a rewatch favorite for a great number of kids, while being a completely enjoyable experience for adults.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Asteroid City</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I don't think I can consider myself a huge Wes Anderson fan. I've seen maybe three or four other movies from him, and while I understand the obsession, I don't particularly feel the same way. This movie was really pretty and really unique. A lot of the dialogue was very wordy and witty, and I laughed at it a bunch of times. The half-movie half-behind-the-scenes-play plot was really cool and I've never seen anything like that. I admit I was a little confused for a while about what was going on with that, and who was who, as a lot of the characters are distant in the camera and look similar, but once it all started to click I felt like this movie might deserve a rewatch for the full experience. I wasn't disappointed at all in my use of two hours to watch this.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Killers of the Flower Moon</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I am sorry to say that I felt much the same about this film as I did about Oppenheimer. The level of cinemamaking is obviously exceptional. The production quality is unmatched. But it just feels so emotionally disconnected and flat. It has the odd moving and powerful scene, but otherwise it's really not much more interesting than a history book. The entire movie feels incredibly ominous because of its speed and the soundtrack, which makes it a difficult three-and-a-half hours to sit through. I was so disappointed. I was hoping for something amazing, something reminiscent of The Revenant or There Will Be Blood, but instead it just felt kinda flat. It needed more focus and a clearer storyline. It felt like it spent so much time on insignificant pieces of the quilt it was weaving, then the quilt didn't quite come out. Like it needed a few more hours to get it done.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    If you have a desire for nostalgic non-stop action, this is the movie for you. Don't think too much about the time travel nearly ruining the storyline (why must all action television nowadays include nonsensical time travel); instead, sit back and let your eyes feast on the beautiful sets and heart-thumping sequences. Even just in the first few minutes, the viewer has already been dropped straight into action that it's hard to take one's eyes off of. It didn't really feel modernized, except for the time travel plot, so the general style of the movie felt like traditional Indiana Jones to me. I know that there's been a whole lot of hate for this movie, but usually those are just grumpy people who want each sequel to be better than the first. Any fan of Indiana Jones should enjoy this finale, and be wholly satisfied. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Fast X</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm no fan of the Fast and Furious movies as a general tendency, but this one was one of the best. As far as storyline and stuff-that-makes-sense happening, Fast X might be top three for me. Jason Momoa in particular was absolutely amazing, which shows the upped quality of the franchise in this movie to be able to allow a talented actor to shine, at least by doing something other than driving a car. All in all, this was one of the movies in this franchise that I enjoyed the most, and I felt an actual depth and quality to the movie that Fast and Furious movies are so famous for lacking.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>The Little Mermaid</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The best way I can describe this movie is beautiful. From the lighting and detail in every sunny scene, pure and gorgeous, to the cinematic beauty of the dark stormy scenes, it is amazing. The storyline is great and classic, plus Ariel's friends (specifically Awkwafina) add a lot of humor. The romance side between the prince and Ariel is done really well and sweetly, Melissa McCarthy's villain (and Javier Bardem's King Triton) is great, and the movie as a whole is a really fun (and rewatchable) two hours.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This movie was really good and really fun. The viewer feels like they know every character in the movie, which adds to the emotional investment of viewing, something that Marvel's been missing for a while. The plot is intense, meaningful, and has a purpose higher than cool fight scenes. There are broken things in the movie, broken beings, and they are redeemed in the characteristic Guardians of the Galaxy way: with a lot of dumb funny stuff. Rocket's backstory was not easy to watch, and I wasn't expecting such gravity in this movie at all when I went in. The two-and-a-half hours went by very quickly. I'm sad that the movie stayed so serious for so much of its runtime, because I feel like Guardians of the Galaxy movies are meant to be comic relief from the rest of the serious MCU, but I suppose that since there isn't much seriousness going on in the rest of the MCU right now it's okay for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 to play both sides.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Covenant</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This was the best movie that I've seen come out since The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. First off, the soundtrack is on par with Manchester by the Sea. The soundtrack holds great responsibility for the emotions of the viewer. I'm not really an expert on this, but I would say that it should win an Oscar for the soundtrack. The writing was good enough for its function, as written complexity is not the point of this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim both pull off absolutely amazing performances, and the movie as a whole makes the viewer feel so very in-the-middle. It also feels as if you get two movies for the price of one; or that the amount of information being viewed is more suitable for a television show, but somehow squeezed into a two-hour movie without feeling rushed in the slightest. The Covenant is amazing.

<h4>Paint</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Paint was a really great movie, despite the general public sentiment disagreeing with me from what I can tell. It had a really sweet storyline hidden behind a lot of flair and distraction. And I do mean a lot. Owen Wilson pulled off a pretty difficult role and the movie as a whole was very well written to be hilarious and feel very heartwarming. I probably smiled and laughed at it more than I have at any new release since I watched the new Puss in Boots, because I don't think Champions did it. It was a very pleasant surprise for my expectations. 
</p>

<h4>Nefarious</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This movie can be really good if the viewer goes in with the right expectations. Think The Screwtape Letters, or a similar direct teaching-through-dialogue sort of communication to the viewer. It watches much like a pastor preaches. I got more settled in as the movie progressed, but I started out pretty disappointed when I realized that the majority of the movie would just be dialogue. While the dialogue, primarily a monologue, was very good, I don't think that it was something that fit very easily into a movie.

<h4>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm too young to have the same Nintendo childhood that so many had, aside from the Wii. As far as connections to Nintendo's beloved characters, Mario Kart was the closest I ever got. I also know and support the issues people have with Nintendo's stubbornness about the use of their old games. However, I loved this movie. I thought that it was a blast of an hour and a half, with so many little hints and setups to remind the viewer of the Nintendo game universe at every turn. I laughed at Bowser, I loved Peach's character, I thought Charlie Day as Luigi was excellent, and I was happy with Chris Pratt's Mario. I finished the movie with zero regrets, and with no part of me unsatisfied. Fast-paced, fun, meaningful, and most of all, colorful, it made me want to go dig up the NES in the basement.

<div>
<h4>Beau Is Afraid</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I think I can say honestly after a few days of reflection that I was a fan of Beau Is Afraid. It's a movie that takes a while to process. In direct comparison to other Ari Asters, I like it better than both Hereditary and Midsommar. While the movie often dove into the odd, difficult-to-understand, and seemingly-disconnected, at least for my first viewing, it never delved into that deep enough to ruin itself. So many scenes were absolute artistry, the biggest two coming to mind being the water-buying scene towards the beginning of the movie and the sex scene towards the end. I haven't been this overwhelmed by something since I saw Uncut Gems. I think Beau Is Afraid is certainly not a movie for the average watcher, but it's a masterpiece for those who enjoy psychological thrillers with a heavy dose of chaos.

<h4>Murder Mystery 2</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I loved the first Murder Mystery, and I loved the way that Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston removed nearly all the seriousness from a whodunit film. It was a blast to watch, and different from anything I'd ever seen before, with the exception of something like Death on the Nile or Knives Out that approaches that lightheartedness. Sadly, however, I wasn't a big fan of this sequel. I thought that it was overdone, felt too much like a reunion and not enough like a movie by itself, and I thought that it was even cheesy at times. While it was certainly not a waste of an hour and a half, and enjoyable to experience, I don't think that it's a movie I'll ever feel like rewatching.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Renfield</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Nicolas Cage pulls off an amazing performance in a movie that's not a waste of time. The movie generally feels purposely weird, with Tarantino-style gore amazing actors, and impressive fight scenes, but obvious cheesiness of plot and many character behaviors. It feels like a high-quality cheap-style PG-13 Dracula thriller. Nicholas Hoult's role is nearly as impressive as Cage's, and Awkwafina and Ben Schwartz add goofy humor to a very serious subject. Awkwafina in particular is key for the mood of everything I've seen her in. I don't think I'll rewatch this, but it was a good display of the talents of multiple actors, and a unique piece of cinema. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Air</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I had no idea what to expect from this movie, but I was really pleasantly surprised by the direction it went. It was really cool to see the way that Nike functioned under the hood to land Michael Jordan, and the scattered clips of his play and teasers for the viewers were a really nice touch. Everything felt very clear and well-done, as far as the acting, storyline, and cinematography, so this was a really easy movie to keep track of and stay interested in. It had some seriously heavy and moving moments, and it made me laugh a little. All in all, a completely satisfying viewing experience.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Shazam! Fury of the Gods</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is not a good movie. I smiled a few times, but that's about it. The writing is trash. In the very first scenes of the movie, superhero physics nonsense already starts happening. One of the other superheros grabs a snapped bridge cable, a single one, and uses it to pull the entire crumbling bridge back into place. Like, what? Then another one of the superheroes is dashing back and forth getting peole off of the bridge and taking them to safety where the emergency services are. The issue with that scene is that those poor people she was carrying should all be dead from concussions. She basically teleported them a few hundred yards instantly, and then they just stumble to a stop at the end. Yeah, their brains are still back in the middle of the bridge. The reason I can spend so much time complaining about two scenes in the first ten or so minutes is because there's really not much else to talk about. I don't understand how someone can write movies this badly. I think they should hire me. I think I could do a better job. Or my little brother, he loves superheroes. Apparently that's all the qualification one needs to be a writer.

<h4>John Wick: Chapter 4</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    As a dedicated 18-year-old fan of John Wick, I had high hopes for this conclusion to the saga. I'm happy to say that my hopes were not disappointed. The viewer gets fight scenes, drama, and depth to rival any action movie, and Keanu Reeves continues to shine. I loved Donnie Yen as a blind ninja, and there were times where he was shining just as much as Keanu. There are scenes that will move the viewer emotionally and make the viewer feel the emotions of the characters more than the viewer has ever experienced in an action movie before. Some of the cinematography and camera shots are simply stunning to behold, and the movie seems to fly through slow conversational scenes without taking a breath from the nonstop action. While I would still be inclined to call the first John Wick my favorite of the series, this last installment certainly makes it a difficult decision. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I heard all about this movie and how amazing it is. I personally didn't fall in with the same excitement. I don't know anything about D&D, so I couldn't appreciate any accuracies of the movie to its source material, which I know is what had so many people losing their minds over it. It was certainly not unenjoyable for me, and it was a decent action/adventure movie, but I wouldn't really recommend the time investment without a liking for D&D itself. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Champions</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'll admit, I was concerned about this one. If I had to imagine an actor who could pull off a very sensitive subject of a film, with appropriate jokes and heartwarmyness, I would not have imagined Woody Harrelson. But I am so happy to report that this movie was great. Harrelson's character is so similar to that of the viewer's, becoming more and more familiar and accepting of the idea of a special-needs basketball team as the movie progresses. The movie ends up being really funny in a way that I wasn't expecting, as it gives some lighthearted deprecating-ish humor to the special needs kids. The viewer can laugh with Harrelson and the other kids on the team at their teammates behavior. All in all, Champions is one of the best feel-good movies I've ever seen, and it doesn't even feel like that's what it's intended for.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Creed III</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I am a huge fan of the Creed movies. I've seen all the Rockys, and I understand the nostalgia for a good Rocky film, but I think that the Creed movies are just better. The cinematography, soundtracks, action, plot, everything is just such high quality. Creed III does such a fantastic job of balancing the generally calm stillness at home with the loud violence in the ring. The viewer feels very immersed in the world being shown on the screen, and it's very easy to empathize with the characters. Michael B. Jordan is amazing as always at carrying the passion of his role while looking good doing it. I love Jonathan Majors and I love the way that he plays troubled characters so perfectly that in so many roles of his the viewer ends up sympathizing with his "bad" character. Tessa Thompson did a fantastic job. I really don't know how to specifically describe it, but I felt like she was responsible for a lot of the non-ring depth in the movie, like back at home. I also love the further distinction given between home and ring by the deafness of their daughter, and how quiet, interactive, and happy their communication with each other generally is around the house. The flashbacks of Adonis Creed give the viewer a fantastic sense of where he's coming from, what's torturing him. I really like these movies.
</p>

<div>
<h4>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    It's very difficult for me to figure out how I feel about this movie. Marvel has been struggling so much recently, and at this point it's bandwagon to say that each new Marvel movie is bad. I don't think that this one can fairly be called that. Is it Shang-Chi, Black Widow, or Far From Home? No. But it's still very enjoyable, and still a good movie. I struggled the most with lazy writing plot-wise. There were way too many stupid reasons why something happened a certain way. Why on Earth would Janet never tell them about the places she went to? Why did that have to stay such a dangerous secret? And little things, like Jentorra saying "You led them right to us!" to Paul Rudd, ten minutes after nonconsentually kidnapping them and bringing them back to their base. It just feels low-quality. Paul Rudd and Bill Murray were great, I certainly laughed many times, but it's not the same quality of Marvel we wish for, that we used to get. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Knock at the Cabin</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm a big Shyamalan fan, but I was disappointed with this movie. I did exclaim twice, with a wow at the tsunami and a wow at some of the planes dropping out of the sky. It was unreal to see CGI for those events that are, for the tsunami, found usually on shaky phone footage, or for the planes, not found at all. Other than those animations, I didn't find the movie particularly interesting or the ending particularly worthy of a Shyamalan film. The viewer spends the whole movie waiting for the apocalypse situation to be explained, and it really just never is. It was nice, however, to see Dave Bautista in a more delicate role than I usually see him in. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Plenty funny at times, with an engaging storyline and outstanding performances, Operation Fortune was an enjoyable two hours. Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza especially shined in their roles, with Plaza making me laugh often and Grant pulling off yet another impossible role. Nearly everything tech-related, however, was hilariously bad, to the point where I wondered if it was purposeful. For example, the item the movie centered around was an AI capable of hacking *anything*, including other AIs. Fascinating. But all in all, the movie was enjoyable and not a waste of time.

<h4>Babylon</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Babylon is a really difficult movie to give a complete opinion on because there's just so much going on in it. I can give three major takeaways for this movie. One: this movie somehow felt like a blend between Wolf of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. That was amazing and so very fun. Two: Brad Pitt was cracking me up and providing a performance just as good as his in the aforementioned film. He never ceases to shine, no matter the importance or style of his role. Three: Margot Robbie is the best female actor I know, by a very very long shot. She is absolutely fabulous. She pulled off a more Wolf of Wall Street role, and took over the movie without a doubt. She blows my mind no matter what she's in. If one can handle the nudity and violence, this movie is a must-watch.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is a really fun movie. I loved it. I don't think there have been very many recent animated releases that can rival it. Not only does it have a fantastic storyline with serious depth (and a seriously scary bad guy), Puss in Boots and his companions are just so darn loveable. I laughed at this movie a lot, and so did the rest of my family.
</p>
</div>
        
<div>
<h4>Avatar: The Way of Water</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I went into this movie with pretty low expectations, knowing that the Avatar movies are famous for their looks and not for much else. I wasn't expecting to be incredibly enthralled by just the animation. But I was. This movie was absolutely gorgeous. I honestly don't actually remember much of the storyline, because that was kinda just a distraction from how it looked. I definitely wish I had seen this in theaters, because it was beautiful on my laptop and I'm confident that my mind would have been blown had I seen it on the big screen.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Strange World</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This world was certainly strange but also fun and beautiful. The storyline was fun and engaging and it was worth a watch. My criticism is that the sexual preferences of a middle-school-aged kid were discussed way too much and made me as the viewer feel very uncomfortable. This movie makes me feel like the writers really wanted to push their agenda. I'm sick and tired of child romance being pushed so hard and with such an agenda in so many movies. At least most of those movies are flopping, hopefully sending signals the filmmakers will hear.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Spirited</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I don't like musicals, but I like Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell each probably more than the average guy my age. The writing of this movie was so witty and funny, and I laughed at it so much. It had such a great Christmas feel, making it a worthy contender (and possibly victor) to the traditional Christmas family movie in my family, Elf. The message of the movie and relative simplicity of it all means that children can enjoy this movie just as much as the adults do. I was in no way disappointed in this movie and it was a work of art.
</p>
</div>
        
<div>
<h4>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This sequel was at least nearly as good as the first. Chadwick Boseman was written out in sad and beautiful form, and the movie moved on without any further delay. I adored seeing the Central American culture throughout the movie, and the CGI shot of the underwater city was the most beautiful and awe-inspiring scene I've seen in the MCU, second (or tied) to only the similar shot from Loki inside the TVA. The movie kept a really nice pace, Namor was cool, and it felt like really high-quality Marvel. 
</p>
</div>
        
<div>
<h4>Enola Holmes 2</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I really enjoyed this movie and its prequel. The style of partial 4th-wall breakage fits really well with the light action of the movie, and they're both really easy popcorn movies. They give a really good modern twist to Sherlock Holmes, without having to ruin anything classic. And I am a fan of classic Sherlock Holmes, as I read it repeatedly in middle school. This movie, as well as the one that came before, was much more enjoyable than I had expected it to be. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Black Adam</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    If you have a desire to see a muscular Dwayne Johnson in action scenes, this is the movie for you. If you have a desire to see a decent superhero movie, try a different one. I really wanted to like this movie. But there was just nothing there. It was an expensive cheap flick full of holes and flaws that didn't live up to the advertising. Maybe if they'd spent their advertising budget on hiring my elementary-school brother to write the movie it would have turned out better. *Sigh*. I wish superhero movies were good like they used to be. I don't understand what happened. And I don't know why they keep churning them out like this, because they aren't making money.
</p>
</div>
        
<div>
<h4>Hocus Pocus 2</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap"> 
    You may ask, was this sequel really needed? No, it wasn't, and don't have great expectations for it if you haven't seen it. For some reason, it felt less like a reunion and more like a sequel. That wasn't done very well, so it has the dumb plot and lack of quality of the original, but without the original's originality and cult following to pull through. I found the original at least bearable, even though I wasn't a big fan, but this sequel just wasn't good. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Amsterdam</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I thought this movie was really beautiful and had a great plot that never left the viewer bored. It was really easy to enjoy because the speed was excellent, the quality was really high, and the cast (and their performances) was fantastic. The cast is humongous for what feels like such a little movie, and it was done really well to not feel like the actors are wasted in their roles. All in all, I had heard that this movie wasn't very good, but I thoroughly disagree and enjoyed it quite a bit. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Glass Onion</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Glass Onion felt like a pretty satisfactory sequel to Knives Out, which is admittedly pretty tough to beat. While Glass Onion starts out feeling more like a reunion than an actual movie in itself, it very quickly throws off any theories the viewer may have had and tosses them straight into another mind-boggling adventure, set in a considerably fancier environment than the original. It's difficult to be more immersed and invested in a movie than I was in this one. I liked this movie a lot, and it was much better than I expected it to be. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>The Menu</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I heard some really good things about the implications and analogies that could be drawn from this movie, but I personally wasn't a huge fan of it. I think any such analogies went over my head, but I did really enjoy the way that food critic was so easy to make fun of. Her snobbiness and the behavior of her partner was hilarious. I found the ending a little vague and disappointing, which was unfortunate because I really felt like the movie depended on that to pull it all together. The film itself felt very unique in style and had many fascinating scenes, but I wasn't a fan overall.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Sisu</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I felt like this movie delivered exactly what the trailer I saw showed. In other words, I was in no way disappointed. Imagine John Wick, but a simple one-protagonist one-antagonist hack-and-slash where about seven characters say words. I was entertained, but it's not worth seeing again. I'm sure that those who have more of a liking than I do for a similar genre of movies will find this movie 100% rewatchable. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>The Woman King</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I had barely any idea what this movie was about or no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch it. I ended up being very pleasantly surprised. Two things in particular stood out. One, I thought that it was beautiful to see so much of the culture of that area and its people. I've seen almost nothing else cinematic set in Africa, and I thought it was beautiful. The other thing was the use of violence in the movie. I thought that the movie was on a really good line where the violence wasn't severe enough to turn away a large number of viewers, but still severe enough to show the seriousness and, in a way, horror of the relevant aspects of the film. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Don't Worry Darling</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I was expecting a good bit for the movie and wasn't disappointed. What it ended up feeling like was a toned-down version of Midsommar, suitable for a wider audience. I thought that Pugh and Styles both pulled off amazing performances, and the viewer was kept well in suspense of what was going on, until the right moment when the movie gave the viewer a look behind the scenes of the simulation. There were a lot of emotional scenes that pulled the empathy of the viewer, like Pugh's shift after shift at the hospital, and I thought the ending black screen with Pugh's awakening gasps was an amazing way to end it all. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Banshees of Inisherin</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I came into this movie hoping that it would be one of my favorites ever. I've seen all of McDonagh's films, and I was excited for some pure and deeply Irish comedy. As the movie got started, I watched with eagerness and hope as it had an even better feel than I had imagined. Then, a character cut his finger off. I began to get confused. I began to wonder why the movie would go that direction. More missing fingers followed. Deep depressing sadness. Very little humor. And a cut to black screen at the end, at a completely "wrong" place. It was absolute garbage. It was the highest-quality garbage I've ever seen, but still garbage. It felt as if it led the viewers on through a comedy's start, but got simply horribly depressing as it went on. I don't have an issue with dark and depressing movies. But this one just felt plain wrong, and I like to not think about it. I'd rather pretend it turned out as well as it seemed it would in the first few minutes.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Whale</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I think I can accurately say that I found this movie amazing. That's not a conclusion I came to immediately, as it took me a while to process through The Whale. I watched it right before Brendan Fraser won an Oscar for it, and I was so glad that he did, because regardless of how I felt about the movie as a whole, there was no denying the impressiveness and value of his role and performance. Fraser carried the emotions of the main character so well and it was so easy for the viewer to see and understand how The Whale felt, making the viewer identify with the movie on a very deep level. That's especially significant because the entire point of the movie is that Charlie's struggle isn't one that we can easily relate to or understand. The Whale certainly gave me a new understanding of the struggles those who are as overweight as Charlie can go through, something I really hadn't thought much about before. As far as the movie outside of Brendan Fraser, well, my main disappointment was just that I felt like too much happened away from Charlie, even though I know that some may feel the camera barely pointed away from him. This movie was great.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>DC League of Super-Pets</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I watched this movie on a whim because I hadn't seen anything like it before. It looked fun and had an interesting cast, so I assumed it would be a good time. I wasn't disappointed, and enjoyed myself. It wasn't rewatch-worthy or anything for me, but think it would be a favorite for a lot of kids.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Bullet Train</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This was one of the most fun movies I've seen in a while, my favorite since Unbearable Weight. It was also certainly the biggest piece of eye candy I've seen this year. It was gorgeous. So much Japanese color and action, I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Add Lemon and Tangerine's banter and Pitt's nonchalance and irritation about his "work", and it's a fantastic movie.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Thor: Love and Thunder</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    While there was a whole lot of hype for this being a big summer superhero flick, I was mostly disappointed by the hype. By no means was it an unenjoyable time, but I was hoping for a little more. I laughed plenty and thought the new characters and plots introduced were fascinating. The biggest issue about the movie was the scene with Thor's nudity. I struggle to figure out how I feel about it, as I entirely agree with the concerns about it being wrong to depict as funny, but I also see the comedic value in it and found it funny myself. It has to be left up to each viewer to decide for themselves if that scene should have been included. But in general, the movie was fun even though it wasn't the summer flick I hoped for. 
</p>
</div>
            
<div>
<h4>Lightyear</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    An entirely satisfying action movie in my opinion. Obviously there was one scene of iffy morality, but other than that, it was a pretty good kid's action movie. As far as relevancy to the source material, I didn't really care. I thought it had a good plot and was funny. The world and characters were made well and it was easy to care. I'm not sure how I would feel about a hypothetical kid of mine watching it because of the pushed agenda, but if that scene were gone it would be great.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Minions: The Rise of Gru</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The Rise of Gru was worthy sequel to the other four movies in the series. I've been a huge fan of Despicable Me since I was little, and they still make me laugh a lot, every single one. It was really cool to see the saga staying strong and fun. I'm sure I'll end up rewatching this just like I've rewatched all the others. 
</p>
</div>    

<div>
<h4>What Is a Woman?</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I wouldn't describe myself as a fan of Matt Walsh specifically. I'm a huge fan of The Daily Wire, but I lean towards Shapiro for talk-show-host preference. I think that Walsh stirs up a lot of drama unnecessarily, and I'm not sure how productive that is. However, there are times he hits the nail on the head. Off the top of my head, the most recent big hit was his speech to the school board. This documentary is absolutely another hit. I hope that it has an impact further than just supporters of The Daily Wire. It would be sad for such a good documentary to do nothing but strengthen the views of those who already agree. My desire is for it to open the minds of many others, and I think it says a lot about someone if they're unwilling (or scared) to give the documentary a try.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Elvis</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    If you know me, you know I'm way too young to know barely anything about Elvis. I've heard a couple of songs, and I didn't know much else before this movie. I thought that Austin Butler pulled off a fantastic performance and there was enough history to make sure even I understood what was going on. The only thing I was bothered by was that the movie focused so much on Tom Hanks' character, and it felt like Elvis' good days were barely visible in the movie. I was disappointed, as I'm someone who didn't get to experience Elvis' good days, so a film like this one was my best shot. But all in all, I was really glad I got this movie under my belt. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Jurassic World: Dominion</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Unfortunately, the quality of the Jurassic movies continues to decrease. The Jurassic Parks were before my time, but I enjoyed them. The first Jurassic World was really good, maybe as good as the first Jurassic Park to me, but the others have gone downhill into pointless action. If a viewer is just interested in dinosaurs and action, this movie will satisfy. If a viewer's looking for something a little more lasting, I'm afraid this isn't it.

<h4>Top Gun: Maverick</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I watched the original Top Gun just a few days before seeing the sequel in theaters so that I would know what was going on. I thoroughly enjoyed the first, and enjoyed the sequel more. I don't know if I'll ever rewatch either, but they're certainly top-of-the-line action that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat. Especially in this sequel, I've rarely seen that much testosterone and fuel in one place. I think if I had any interest in fighter planes myself, Top Gun: Maverick would be one of my favorite movies.

<h4>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This new Marvel movie felt entirely mad for sure. So much happened during the movie that it was mildly difficult to follow, but I was generally pretty satisfied with this addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I was loving the Nordic mythology and castles. It was cool to see other MCU characters showing up from the Multiverse, although I question how many will end up with permanent roles in the MCU. Sometimes I feel like Marvel is wasting characters and actors by just dumping quick roles into movies like this one and limiting future options with those characters. I'm not sure if we'll get to see John Krasinski and Patrick Stewart again in the MCU, but I do hope so.

<h4>Father Stu</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    It's refreshing to see Christianity on the big screen every once in a while. And coming from big names, with a whole lot of humor and quality, this movie was great. I stayed interested and awaiting the story. Emotion was clear throughout the film and carried the viewer on a beautiful journey. I think it's a must-see for Christians with a stomach for some violence, or for anybody open-minded about religious values and worldviews. I'll definitely be rewatching this.

<h4>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I don't consider myself a fan of Harry Potter because I generally find the plots and circumstances of the books and movies a bit heavy and dark for a children's series. I liked all three Fantastic Beasts movies for the simple reason that they felt a little more appropriately age-targeted. Not only did they appeal to an older audience, but the gloom of the Harry Potter movies was cut down on, making the Fantastic Beasts world one I'd much prefer to live in out of the two. As far as this third one in particular, I thought it was goofy and quirky. It had great animation and loveable characters. The plot was iffy at times, and I wish they could have kept Johnny Depp as Grindelwald. Especially for me watching all three within a week of each other, it's just annoying for casting to change.

<h4>Morbius</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Obviously I was aware of how dreadful this movie was supposed to be. I mean, it was bad. But worse than half of the other action movies released nowadays? Not really. I think it being dark and gloomy gave the effect of being worse than it actually was. Also, it being a bigger studio that released it gives bias, admittedly warranted bias because quality should be expected. But quality isn't delivered in a lot of big-name action movies anymore. Morbius was bad. It wasn't revolutionarily so.

<h4>The Bad Guys</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    My little brother is a big fan of The Bad Guys comics, and I saw this movie was being received well, so I decided to give it a try. I was very happy with it. It was super fun, had great animation, and was funny. I stayed interested the whole time, and I enjoyed seeing a little bit of a different style of 2D animation. It felt more like a Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse style of animation, but more goofy and kids'-comic-y instead of superhero-comic-y. It was refreshing to see because of how different it was from anything I've seen before and how just across-the-board good it is as a children's movie.

<h4>Cheaper by the Dozen</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I watched this movie partially by accident because I was just on the couch in the room. I haven't seen the original. This remake was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It held no value. There was nothing to review. I understand now what people mean when they talk about trashy soap operas.

<h4>The Lost City</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I saw this movie in theaters as my girlfriend was excited for it as a big fan of Sandra Bullock. I thought it was pretty enjoyable for such a quick action flick. It was funny and had an engaging storyline. Brad Pitt cracked me up. I doubt I'll ever end up rewatching this but I know for sure I enjoyed the time I spent. I think it's the cheap action so many movies aspire to be and fall so short. It was refreshing to experience.

<h4>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The funniest movie I've seen in a long time, I laughed through a whole lot of it. I've also never seen anything with such great fanboying. I never would have imagined a whole movie with Pedro Pascal drooling over Nick Cage, but my goodness was it great. And seeing Nick Cage playing himself was fantastic; that made just about every interaction funny just in itself because of the absurdity of it all. In general it was just an experience unlike anything I've ever had before, and it was great. I think any fan of comedy has to watch it, and for Nicolas Cage fans it's a treasure. I'm not a Cage cultist but this movie got me close to considering a membership.

<h4>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I gave this movie a nice chance because of the attention it was getting, and I was seriously disappointed. I didn't really feel like the movie had anything of value in it. If I'm looking for something multiversal to watch, I'll put on some Marvel. It was chaotic as the name implied, but making a chaotic movie to match its title doesn't make a quality film. It was generally just a lot of random things happening one after the other, with minimal connectedness, more in the style of an experiment than something that should pull box office numbers. The disconnected clips were rarely even good.

<h4>The Batman</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    While no Nolan Batman trilogy, there was certain quality in this film. I enjoyed it greatly. There were so many scenes that were cinematic perfection. I'm no critic of the slow pace because I thought that it was done really well and gave an amazing brooding feel to the movie. It felt like one of the best-crafted movies I've seen in a long time. I really think it's a necessary experience for anyone with an interest in any related genre.

<h4>Turning Red</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I heard that this movie was mostly an annoy-fest. I heard that many of the characters were just annoying to watch and not really fun kids to experience. I have to admit that I agree. It's not a particularly pleasant kids' movie to make the kids in the movie kids a parent wouldn't want their kids to act like. The biggest positive thing was the animation, as it was pretty fun at times.

<h4>The Adam Project</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    As a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds I had high hopes for this movie. A good supporting cast and a seemingly interesting storyline made me eager to see how it turned out. I was generally disappointed. It's difficult for me to explain why. I just didn't feel like the storyline followed super well and I was hoping for a lot more humor than it ended up having. I didn't dislike the movie but it wasn't particularly notable in my opinion.

<h4>Death on the Nile</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap"> 
    I've seen all of my first whodunits very recently. So far I'm not really super into them but I can entirely see the appeal. This movie in particular did an incredibly good job keeping the answers hidden until the end, and it was super easy and exciting to follow. The drama and suspense were kept high without ever sacrificing the storyline, which is difficult to do. I would say that for fans of this genre, this should be a favorite.
</p>

<div>
<h4>Uncharted</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    An action flick with a great cast and a fun storyline, there really isn't much to complain about here. I enjoyed it as much as I have any other standalone plain action/adventure movie, and it was the first one for me in that genre that I really considered a high-quality movie. I'm generally not one to care for action when its primary intention is the raising of the viewer's heartbeat, but Uncharted was funny enough and well-written enough, both without deviating from its simple genre, to keep me interested.
