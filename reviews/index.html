<div>
<h4>Barbie</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is a really hard review for me to write objectively. My feelings were hurt. I understand the point of the movie entirely. If women were truly as societally discriminated against as the movie claims, (I think) everything about the movie would be a valid call-out. But they're just not, plain and simple. I am sure that many women face discrimination every day. But that is not societal. Heck, one gets sued and burned to the ground at any hint of misogyny. Women won the women's rights movement, and I'm glad they did. But now the women's rights movement, which is unnecessary, has transitioned to a blatantly and brutally misandric movement. It's a now-it's-our-turn mentality, exactly as Barbie showed. I don't really know what else to say. The movie is absolute sexism in pretty pink. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Nimona</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I had heard from multiple sources that this movie has the best 2D animation since Disney in the 90s and 00s. I didn't hear as much about the storyline. I was disappointed in both. There was too much going on animation-wise; I greatly prefer the goofiness of the new Spider-Mans if the recipe has deviated from Hercules and The Princess and the Frog. The storyline felt as jumbled as the animation at times, and often the speed and lack of explanation with which it progressed was very detrimental to the movie. Also, it fails to feel unpreachy to have two guys kiss front and center about two minutes into a kids' movie.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Asteroid City</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I don't think I can consider myself a huge Wes Anderson fan. I've seen maybe three or four other movies from him, and while I understand the obsession, I don't particularly feel the same way. This movie was really pretty and really unique. A lot of the dialogue was very wordy and witty, and I laughed at it a bunch of times. The half-movie half-behind-the-scenes-play plot was really cool and I've never seen anything like that. I admit I was a little confused for a while about what was going on with that, and who was who, as a lot of the characters are distant in the camera and look similar, but once it all started to click I felt like this movie might deserve a rewatch for the full experience. I wasn't disappointed at all in my use of two hours to watch this.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Elemental</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Elemental was a beautiful world to behold. While the storyline and characters weren't particularly noteable in my opinion, they certainly weren't a problem, and the viewer is distracted otherwise with the scale of, and attention to detail in, the created world on the screen. I can totally see it becoming a rewatch favorite for a great number of kids, while being a completely enjoyable experience for adults.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Little Mermaid</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The best way I can describe this movie is beautiful. From the lighting and detail in every sunny scene, pure and gorgeous, to the cinematic beauty of the dark stormy scenes, it is amazing. The storyline is great and classic, plus Ariel's friends (specifically Awkwafina) add a lot of humor. The romance side between the prince and Ariel is done really well and sweetly, Melissa McCarthy's villain (and Javier Bardem's King Triton) is great, and the movie as a whole is a really fun (and rewatchable) two hours.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Fast X</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm no fan of the Fast and Furious movies as a general tendency, but this one was one of the best. As far as storyline and stuff-that-makes-sense happening, Fast X might be top three for me. Jason Momoa in particular was absolutely amazing, which shows the upped quality of the franchise in this movie to be able to allow a talented actor to shine, at least by doing something other than driving a car. All in all, this was one of the movies in this franchise that I enjoyed the most, and I felt an actual depth and quality to the movie that Fast and Furious movies are so famous for lacking.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This movie was really good and really fun. The viewer feels like they know every character in the movie, which adds to the emotional investment of viewing, something that Marvel's been missing for a while. The plot is intense, meaningful, and has a purpose higher than cool fight scenes. There are broken things in the movie, broken beings, and they are redeemed in the characteristic Guardians of the Galaxy way: with a lot of dumb funny stuff. Rocket's backstory was not easy to watch, and I wasn't expecting such gravity in this movie at all when I went in. The two-and-a-half hours went by very quickly. I'm sad that the movie stayed so serious for so much of its runtime, because I feel like Guardians of the Galaxy movies are meant to be comic relief from the rest of the serious MCU, but I suppose that since there isn't much seriousness going on in the rest of the MCU right now it's okay for Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 to play both sides.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Sisu</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I felt like this movie delivered exactly what the trailer I saw showed. In other words, I was in no way disappointed. Imagine John Wick, but a simple one-protagonist one-antagonist hack-and-slash where about seven characters say words. I was entertained, but it's not worth seeing again. I'm sure that those who have more of a liking than I do for a similar genre of movies will find this movie 100% rewatchable. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Beau Is Afraid</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I think I can say honestly after a few days of reflection that I was a fan of Beau Is Afraid. It's a movie that takes a while to process. In direct comparison to other Ari Asters, I like it better than both Hereditary and Midsommar. While the movie often dove into the odd, difficult-to-understand, and seemingly-disconnected, at least for my first viewing, it never delved into that deep enough to ruin itself. So many scenes were absolute artistry, the biggest two coming to mind being the water-buying scene towards the beginning of the movie and the sex scene towards the end. I haven't been this overwhelmed by something since I saw Uncut Gems. I think Beau Is Afraid is certainly not a movie for the average watcher, but it's a masterpiece for those who enjoy psychological thrillers with a heavy dose of chaos. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>The Covenant</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This was the best movie that I've seen come out since The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent. First off, the soundtrack is on par with Manchester by the Sea. The soundtrack holds great responsibility for the emotions of the viewer. I'm not really an expert on this, but I would say that it should win an Oscar for the soundtrack. The writing was good enough for its function, as written complexity is not the point of this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim both pull off absolutely amazing performances, and the movie as a whole makes the viewer feel so very in-the-middle. It also feels as if you get two movies for the price of one; or that the amount of information being viewed is more suitable for a television show, but somehow squeezed into a two-hour movie without feeling rushed in the slightest. The Covenant is amazing.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Nefarious</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This movie can be really good if the viewer goes in with the right expectations. Think The Screwtape Letters, or a similar direct teaching-through-dialogue sort of communication to the viewer. It watches much like a pastor preaches. I got more settled in as the movie progressed, but I started out pretty disappointed when I realized that the majority of the movie would just be dialogue. While the dialogue, primarily a monologue, was very good, I don't think that it was something that fit very easily into a movie. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Paint</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Paint was a really great movie, despite the general public sentiment disagreeing with me from what I can tell. It had a really sweet storyline hidden behind a lot of flair and distraction. And I do mean a lot. Owen Wilson pulled off a pretty difficult role and the movie as a whole was very well written to be hilarious and feel very heartwarming. I probably smiled and laughed at it more than I have at any new release since I watched the new Puss in Boots, because I don't think Champions did it. It was a very pleasant surprise for my expectations. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm too young to have the same Nintendo childhood that so many had, aside from the Wii. As far as connections to Nintendo's beloved characters, Mario Kart was the closest I ever got. I also know and support the issues people have with Nintendo's stubbornness about the use of their old games. However, I loved this movie. I thought that it was a blast of an hour and a half, with so many little hints and setups to remind the viewer of the Nintendo game universe at every turn. I laughed at Bowser, I loved Peach's character, I thought Charlie Day as Luigi was excellent, and I was happy with Chris Pratt's Mario. I finished the movie with zero regrets, and with no part of me unsatisfied. Fast-paced, fun, meaningful, and most of all, colorful, it made me want to go dig up the NES in the basement.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Murder Mystery 2</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I loved the first Murder Mystery, and I loved the way that Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston removed nearly all the seriousness from a whodunit film. It was a blast to watch, and different from anything I'd ever seen before, with the exception of something like Death on the Nile or Knives Out that approaches that lightheartedness. Sadly, however, I wasn't a big fan of this sequel. I thought that it was overdone, felt too much like a reunion and not enough like a movie by itself, and I thought that it was even cheesy at times. While it was certainly not a waste of an hour and a half, and enjoyable to experience, I don't think that it's a movie I'll ever feel like rewatching.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I heard all about this movie and how amazing it is. I personally didn't fall in with the same excitement. I don't know anything about D&D, so I couldn't appreciate any accuracies of the movie to its source material, which I know is what had so many people losing their minds over it. It was certainly not unenjoyable for me, and it was a decent action/adventure movie, but I wouldn't really recommend the time investment without a liking for D&D itself. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>John Wick: Chapter 4</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    As a dedicated 18-year-old fan of John Wick, I had high hopes for this conclusion to the saga. I'm happy to say that my hopes were not disappointed. The viewer gets fight scenes, drama, and depth to rival any action movie, and Keanu Reeves continues to shine. I loved Donnie Yen as a blind ninja, and there were times where he was shining just as much as Keanu. There are scenes that will move the viewer emotionally and make the viewer feel the emotions of the characters more than the viewer has ever experienced in an action movie before. Some of the cinematography and camera shots are simply stunning to behold, and the movie seems to fly through slow conversational scenes without taking a breath from the nonstop action. While I would still be inclined to call the first John Wick my favorite of the series, this last installment certainly makes it a difficult decision. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Shazam! Fury of the Gods</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is not a good movie. I smiled a few times, but that's about it. The writing is trash. In the very first scenes of the movie, superhero physics nonsense already starts happening. One of the other superheros grabs a snapped bridge cable, a single one, and uses it to pull the entire crumbling bridge back into place. Like, what? Then another one of the superheroes is dashing back and forth getting peole off of the bridge and taking them to safety where the emergency services are. The issue with that scene is that those poor people she was carrying should all be dead from concussions. She basically teleported them a few hundred yards instantly, and then they just stumble to a stop at the end. Yeah, their brains are still back in the middle of the bridge. The reason I can spend so much time complaining about two scenes in the first ten or so minutes is because there's really not much else to talk about. I don't understand how someone can write movies this badly. I think they should hire me. I think I could do a better job. Or my little brother, he loves superheroes. Apparently that's all the qualification one needs to be a writer.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Champions</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'll admit, I was concerned about this one. If I had to imagine an actor who could pull off a very sensitive subject of a film, with appropriate jokes and heartwarmyness, I would not have imagined Woody Harrelson. But I am so happy to report that this movie was great. Harrelson's character is so similar to that of the viewer's, becoming more and more familiar and accepting of the idea of a special-needs basketball team as the movie progresses. The movie ends up being really funny in a way that I wasn't expecting, as it gives some lighthearted deprecating-ish humor to the special needs kids. The viewer can laugh with Harrelson and the other kids on the team at their teammates behavior. All in all, Champions is one of the best feel-good movies I've ever seen, and it doesn't even feel like that's what it's intended for.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<h4>Creed III</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I am a huge fan of the Creed movies. I've seen all the Rockys, and I understand the nostalgia for a good Rocky film, but I think that the Creed movies are just better. The cinematography, soundtracks, action, plot, everything is just such high quality. Creed III does such a fantastic job of balancing the generally calm stillness at home with the loud violence in the ring. The viewer feels very immersed in the world being shown on the screen, and it's very easy to empathize with the characters. Michael B. Jordan is amazing as always at carrying the passion of his role while looking good doing it. I love Jonathan Majors and I love the way that he plays troubled characters so perfectly that in so many roles of his the viewer ends up sympathizing with his "bad" character. Tessa Thompson did a fantastic job. I really don't know how to specifically describe it, but I felt like she was responsible for a lot of the non-ring depth in the movie, like back at home. I also love the further distinction given between home and ring by the deafness of their daughter, and how quiet, interactive, and happy their communication with each other generally is around the house. The flashbacks of Adonis Creed give the viewer a fantastic sense of where he's coming from, what's torturing him. I really like these movies.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    It's very difficult for me to figure out how I feel about this movie. Marvel has been struggling so much recently, and at this point it's bandwagon to say that each new Marvel movie is bad. I don't think that this one can fairly be called that. Is it Shang-Chi, Black Widow, or Far From Home? No. But it's still very enjoyable, and still a good movie. I struggled the most with lazy writing plot-wise. There were way too many stupid reasons why something happened a certain way. Why on Earth would Janet never tell them about the places she went to? Why did that have to stay such a dangerous secret? And little things, like Jentorra saying "You led them right to us!" to Paul Rudd, ten minutes after nonconsentually kidnapping them and bringing them back to their base. It just feels low-quality. Paul Rudd and Bill Murray were great, I certainly laughed many times, but it's not the same quality of Marvel we wish for, that we used to get.

<div>
<h4>Glass Onion</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Glass Onion felt like a pretty satisfactory sequel to Knives Out, which is admittedly pretty tough to beat. While Glass Onion starts out feeling more like a reunion than an actual movie in itself, it very quickly throws off any theories the viewer may have had and tosses them straight into another mind-boggling adventure, set in a considerably fancier environment than the original. It's difficult to be more immersed and invested in a movie than I was in this one. I liked this movie a lot, and it was much better than I expected it to be. 
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Babylon</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Babylon is a really difficult movie to give a complete opinion on because there's just so much going on in it. I can give three major takeaways for this movie. One: this movie somehow felt like a blend between Wolf of Wall Street and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. That was amazing and so very fun. Two: Brad Pitt was cracking me up and providing a performance just as good as his in the aforementioned film. He never ceases to shine, no matter the importance or style of his role. Three: Margot Robbie is the best female actor I know, by a very very long shot. She is absolutely fabulous. She pulled off a more Wolf of Wall Street role, and took over the movie without a doubt. She blows my mind no matter what she's in. If one can handle the nudity and violence, this movie is a must-watch.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    This is a really fun movie. I loved it. I don't think there have been very many recent animated releases that can rival it. Not only does it have a fantastic storyline with serious depth (and a seriously scary bad guy), Puss in Boots and his companions are just so darn loveable. I laughed at this movie a lot, and so did the rest of my family.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>The Whale</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I think I can accurately say that I found this movie amazing. That's not a conclusion I came to immediately, as it took me a while to process through The Whale. I watched it right before Brendan Fraser won an Oscar for it, and I was so glad that he did, because regardless of how I felt about the movie as a whole, there was no denying the impressiveness and value of his role and performance. Fraser carried the emotions of the main character so well and it was so easy for the viewer to see and understand how The Whale felt, making the viewer identify with the movie on a very deep level. That's especially significant because the entire point of the movie is that Charlie's struggle isn't one that we can easily relate to or understand. The Whale certainly gave me a new understanding of the struggles those who are as overweight as Charlie can go through, something I really hadn't thought much about before. As far as the movie outside of Brendan Fraser, well, my main disappointment was just that I felt like too much happened away from Charlie, even though I know that some may feel the camera barely pointed away from him. This movie was great.
</p>
</div>
    
<div>
<h4>Avatar: The Way of Water</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I went into this movie with pretty low expectations, knowing that the Avatar movies are famous for their looks and not for much else. I wasn't expecting to be incredibly enthralled by just the animation. But I was. This movie was absolutely gorgeous. I honestly don't actually remember much of the storyline, because that was kinda just a distraction from how it looked. I definitely wish I had seen this in theaters, because it was beautiful on my laptop and I'm confident that my mind would have been blown had I seen it on the big screen.
