<h4>Creed III</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I am a huge fan of the Creed movies. I've seen all the Rockys, and I understand the nostalgia for a good Rocky film, but I think that the Creed movies are just better. The cinematography, soundtracks, action, plot, everything is just such high quality. Creed III does such a fantastic job of balancing the generally calm stillness at home with the loud violence in the ring. The viewer feels very immersed in the world being shown on the screen, and it's very easy to empathize with the characters. Michael B. Jordan is amazing as always at carrying the passion of his role while looking good doing it. I love Jonathan Majors and I love the way that he plays troubled characters so perfectly that in so many roles of his the viewer ends of sympathizing with his character. Tessa Thompson did a fantastic job. I really don't know how to specifically describe it, but I felt like she was responsible for a lot of the non-ring depth in the movie, like back at home. I also love the further distinction given between home and ring by the deafness of their daughter, and how quiet, interactive, and happy their communication with each other generally is around the house. The flashbacks for Adonis Creed give the viewer a fantastic sense of where he's coming from, what's torturing him. I really like these movies.

<h4>Champions</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'll admit, I was concerned about this one. If I had to imagine an actor who could pull off a very sensitive subject of a film, with appropriate jokes and heartwarmyness, I would not have imagined Woody Harrelson. But I am so happy to report that this movie was great. Harrelson's character was so similar to that of the viewer's, becoming more and more familiar and accepting of the idea of a special-needs basketball team as the movie progressed. The movie ended up being really funny in a way that I wasn't expecting, as it gave some lighthearted deprecating-ish humor to the special needs kids. You can laugh with Harrelson and the other kids on the team at their teammates behavior. All in all, Champions was one of the best feel-good movies I've ever seen, and it doesn't even feel like that's what it's intended for.

<h4>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I'm too young to have the same Nintendo childhood that so many had, aside from the Wii. As far as connections to Nintendo's beloved characters, Mario Kart was the closest I ever got. I also know and support the issues people have with Nintendo's stubbornness about the use of their old games. However, I loved this movie. I thought that it was a blast of an hour and a half, with so many little hints and setups to remind you of the Nintendo game universe at every turn. I laughed at Bowser, loved Peach's character, thought Charlie Day as Luigi was excellent, and was happy with Chris Pratt's Mario. I finished the movie with zero regrets, and with no part of me unsatisfied. Fast-paced, fun, meaningful, and most of all, colorful, it made me want to go dig up the NES in the basement.

<h4>Murder Mystery 2</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    I loved the first Murder Mystery, and I loved the way that Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston removed nearly all the seriousness from a whodunit film. It was a blast to watch, and different from anything I'd ever seen before, with the exception of something like Death on the Nile or Knives Out that approaches that lightheartedness. Sadly, however, I wasn't a big fan of this sequel. I thought that it was overdone, felt too much like a reunion and not enough like a movie itself, and I thought that it was even cheesy at times. While it was certainly not a waste of an hour and a half, and enjoyable to experience, I don't think that it's a movie I'll ever feel like rewatching.

<h4>John Wick: Chapter 4</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    As a dedicated 18-year-old fan of John Wick, I had high hopes for this conclusion to the saga. I'm happy to say that my hopes were not disappointed. The viewer gets fight scenes, drama, and depth to rival any action movie, and Keanu Reeves continues to shine. I loved Donnie Yen as a blind ninja, and there were times where he was shining just as much as Keanu. There are scenes that will move you emotionally and make you feel the emotions of the characters more than you've ever experienced in an action movie before. Some of the cinematography and camera shots are simply stunning to behold, and the movie seems to fly through slow conversational scenes without taking a breath from the nonstop action. While I would still be inclined to call the first John Wick my favorite of the series, this last installment certainly makes it a difficult decision.

<h4>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    It's very difficult for me to figure out how I feel about this movie. Marvel has been struggling so much recently, and at this point it's bandwagon to say that each new Marvel movie is bad. I don't think that this one can fairly be called that. Is it Shang-Chi, Black Widow, or Far From Home? No. But it's still very enjoyable, and still a good movie. I struggled the most with lazy writing plot-wise. There were way too many stupid reasons why something happened a certain way. Why on Earth would Janet never tell them about the places she went to? Why did that have to stay such a dangerous secret? And little things, like Jentorra saying "You led them right to us!" to Paul Rudd, ten minutes after nonconsentually kidnapping them and bringing them back to their base. It just feels low-quality. Paul Rudd and Bill Murray were great, I certainly laughed many times, but it's not the same quality of Marvel we wish for, that we used to get.
