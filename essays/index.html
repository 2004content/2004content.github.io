THE ANDERSONS
"Have a good first day of school!" their parents called as Nathaniel and Elizabeth walked out to the school bus. It was a gorgeous spring day; their mother's flowers were all blossoming in her garden and the trees and grass were strong, healthy, and colored a wonderful shade of deep emerald contrasted with the solid brown of the trunks. It was April 1st, 2208, the first day of spring, around 8 o'clock in the morning. Nathaniel and his sister walked up the steps of the bright yellow bus to the sound of chattering children and the low hum of an electric motor, saying hello to the smiling bus driver. When they were safely in their seats and the bus started moving again, Elizabeth leaned over to her brother.
"I think that our bus driver is named Mr. Cody! I read about him in the local paper. He won some award for the kindest bus driver in the district."
"Elizabeth, we just moved here. How could you know that already?"
"I learned as much as I could about Manorville before we came, so that I wouldn't have to stick out like a sore thumb."
Nathaniel just shook his head and looked out the window at the neat little houses flying by.
They went to school from 8am to 4pm, five days a week, and had a school year lasting from April to the end of November, with a two-week-long break in the beginning of October before they had to prepare for finals, along with other week-long breaks throughout their school year. It was a simple schedule as far as classes went; they went to four classes for an hour and a half each, and had an hour long lunch to socialize and work on homework, with lengthy breaks between classes to encourage the first even more. Nathaniel had Logic and Reasoning to start the day; he had groaned at the thought back home.
Nathaniel wove around students and robots whizzing by with messages to carry to find his classroom without too much effort, as all the classrooms had a two-digit number indicating the hall and individual door. As he walked in, he saw maybe five or six others already seated and talking to one another. He found an open seat near the back and looked around for the teacher.
"Mr. Elliott will be in here in a minute, he probably went to the bathroom or something," said a voice behind him. He turned around and met a girl smiling at him.
"I'm Mae, what's your name?"
"Nathaniel. We just moved here a few days ago."
"Oh I see, I was thinking I hadn't seen you around before. Where did you move from?"
"We used to live farther north in a town called Willingdon, but we moved down to get away from the cold. It's not very good for you after a while."
"I've lived here for all my life. It's not a very large town, but it's a cozy one."
At this moment a teacher walked into the room, and the bell rang a few seconds later. Mae smiled at Nathaniel and he turned around to hear what Mr. Elliott was saying.
When the bell rang after his second class, he went off to find Elizabeth to eat together. He found her talking with a new friend, who she introduced as Claire.
"How have your classes been today, Elizabeth?"
"Not very difficult. They really just introduced us to the subjects today. I'm hoping tomorrow we can get to some real learning."
"I'm sure you are," Nathaniel responded, looking around.
"Who're you looking for?" Elizabeth demanded.
"No one, just looking."
"Sure. Have you met anyone today?"
"Yeah just one person. Look, there she is!" he said, pointing.
Elizabeth gave him a sly look. "What's her name?"
"Mae," Nathaniel replied, giving her a little wave in hopes Mae would notice him.
"Do you know who she is?"
"What do you mean, do I know who she is?" Nathaniel asked, irritated that she hadn't seen him wave.
"She's the mayor's daughter! I found that out when I was looking up the mayor and his family so I'd know," she confided to Claire. "She'd be a boring one to date though. You can't get into any trouble with someone like that."
"Elizabeth! You're too young to be saying things like that, and I never said anything about dating her, I've barely talked to her." Elizabeth and Claire giggled.
Nathaniel scowled and ate the rest of his lunch in silence.
When Nathaniel and Elizabeth got off the bus that afternoon, they were greeted by their mother, who asked them if their first day went okay. "Nathaniel's already got his eyes set on someone, and I made a friend!" Elizabeth said. Nathaniel ignored his sister's statement and said, "I made a friend named Carter. He plays football just like I do." Their mother smiled at them. "Sounds like you had an exciting day! Let's find something to eat before supper."
They went inside and stepped around a few boxes to get to the kitchen, as a cleaning robot whisked around the floor trying to polish the obstacles. "He's been a little confused today," the children's mother said as she prepared something for them to snack on. "Mother," Elizabeth said. "Today one of my friends was telling me that all of our money actually goes to the government and we don't get any of it. Is that true?"
"Yes, sweetie. That's one thing you'll learn about this year. That way every family gets what they need and there's no poverty, like there used to be a hundred years ago. That's why you learn about the Human War in school; it was a result of an old idea called capitalism, where the rich would get richer and the poor would get poorer. The way it is now, everyone gets what they need, and instead of your efforts only advancing yourself, you advance the whole society and economy with your hard work. It really is much better for everyone." 
Nathaniel left the kitchen to go to his room. As he was going up the stairs, a cat came flying down and he had to jump out of the way. As he did, Nathaniel landed on the edge of a stair and toppled back, trying to break his fall with his arm. Nathaniel yelled in pain as he crashed to the ground. His mother and sister came running into the room and gasped. Nathaniel was sitting on the floor, holding his arm. There was a gash all along his palm, down his wrist, and onto his forearm. Out of the tear protruded wires, gears, and cables. 
"I can't feel my hand!" he yelled.
"Oh my gosh!" his mother exclaimed. "I'll take you to the doctor right away. He should be able to disable the nerve sensors and replace your lower arm pretty quickly. You'll be as good as new. Just let me find my keys."
