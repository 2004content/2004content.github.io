<h4>Kentuckian Syren</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    Some of the stuff I listen to is blessthefall, GOJIRA, Norma Jean, Of Mice & Men, LIVE's good album, RAtM, and literally anything by Dax Riggs. Generally, a ton of doom/sludge/stoner metal and hard rock stuff, with some weird slow southern rock thrown in (think "Lightning Crashes"). I like some classical music. Vivaldi, Bach, but not really Mozart and not Beethoven. I haven't listened through any other composers yet. I think that I'll be a big Tchaikovsky fan. I listen to almost zero pop, rap, or country. Except Tyler Childers.
    I found Tyler Childers about a year ago. I like his Purgatory album, his Country Squire album, and my favorite is his first album, Bottles and Bibles, even though I know it's much much less popular. He alone, with those three albums, takes up probably 20-30% of my music listening.
    Tyler Childers released his first album in 2011, when he was 20. His next, Purgatory, didn't come for six more years, and two years after that came Country Squire. He's had two more albums since those, but I don't care for them as much. 
    The thing about Tyler Childers that pulls me in is the passion in his voice. Especially in his first album. In that one, there isn't much going on away from his voice, as opposed to his more heavily-instrumented second and third albums. He also has a very different mood in his first album, much more one of a lonely 20-year-old than one of a more successful 26-year-old (or very successful 28-year-old). 
    The lonely passion I'm talking about can be heard in nearly every sentence throughout the entire album. It absolutely blows my mind. Tyler Childers made me want to learn how to sing.
    I feel that in a way, to me at least, his voice gives such depth, quality, emotion, and meaning to those very hardships he sings about that it makes me wish I were as lonely and hopeless as him, so that I could experience the beauty of his hardships, a.k.a. his singing about it. It's the exact opposite of how one's supposed to feel about hardship. He's like a syren drawing his listener in, saying, "Listen to how gorgeous these awful things I'm going through are."

<h4>Unpained Meat</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    The year is 2035. The animal rights activists have won. The conditions inside of many farms and factories have been deemed unacceptable and inhumane by the majority of the public. However, meat is still in high demand. As a solution, farmers have begun keeping their animals in a drugged state 24/7. The animals are unconscious, with a little bit of drug-induced euphoria. Therefore, they don't know what happens to them from the instant that they're born to when they're "harvested" with the drugs still in their system. For the animals it's a life of pleasant dreams and sleep, for the farmers it's a maintenance of income with mildly increased costs because of the drugs, and for the consumers it's a full cart of delicious meat at the grocery store.
    What is the effect on society? The animal rights activists still aren't happy, but the solution the farmers came up with is supported by the public, so the activists have lost their suppport. Premium meat has become the meat that comes from a family farm, or similar circumstance. Meat that had a life, spent time in the sun, and felt its life draining away at the end. Meat that people pay extra for. The higher price, for the meat that it feels carnivorous to eat.
    But as for those animals that the average person eats: They aren't animals. They're unpained meat, growing at laboratory speeds, with no touch of life, for one purpose: human consumption.

<h4>Kill Virus</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    It's a nice summer afternoon. A group of college friends, six of them, are together at a cabin for the weekend. They're all gathered around the table, eating and laughing, when there's a frantic knock at the door. One of the six gets up and answers the door, and there's a frantic and heavily-breathing also-college-aged girl on the doorstep. 
    The guy answering the door steps back worriedly. Before anyone else can do anything, the girl looks him straight in the eyes.
    "I'm sorry."
    Then she pulls out a revolver and puts three shots into his chest. The other five at the table jump up, some screaming. One, a big, beefy guy, picks up a chair, jumps forward, and smashes it into the face of the girl still standing on the doorstep. She crumples backward. The other four from the table, two guys and two girls, are standing staring at the destruction in utter shock. 
    The guy who swung the chair bent down and checked the pulse of the girl with his finger on her neck.
    "She's dead."
    One of the other girls lets out a short, pitiful squeak. The guy who swung the chair walks over to their friend who's already breathed his last breath. One of the other guys asks if they should call 911. No response is necessary from his friends. He lunges for his phone at the table and rushes outside through a back door. 
    There's silence in the front room of the cabin. The guy calling 911 can be heard through the back screen door, practically hyperventilating on the phone. 
    After a few more minutes of nobody moving in inch in the cabin, the guy out back comes back in with a slam of the screen door closing back that causes the other four in the room to jump. He tells them that the police are on the way. As he's saying that, he notices that the guy who swung the chair is still crouched down on the floor beside the bodies, not looking up, breathing heavily.
    The guy who called 911 stares down at the guy who swung the chair. As he's watching, the guy who swung the chair tenses and braces himself against the floor. The guy who called 911 steps back. The other three start talking over one another, trying to ask the guy who swung the chair if he's okay. A few seconds later, the guy who swung the chair lept up off of the ground and grabbed one of the girls in the throat with a wild look in his eyes. Screaming ensues yet again as the other guy standing around tries to pull the guy who swung the chair off of the girl. The guy who called in 911 watches in silent horror as the other bystanding girl continues to scream and panic. The guy at the throat of the girl swings out and hits the guy trying to pull him off in the face. The guy who got hit in the face stumbles back with blood running down from his nose. By this point, the girl being choked has gone silent and limp. The girl screaming is no longer screaming. She watches with a hand over her mouth. The only sound in the room is the heavy breathing of the guy at the throat of the girl. While he's still holding her there, the girl who was screaming dashes to the doorway and grabs the revolver from underneath the dead visitor on the doorstep. The guy who called 911 stands watching. The guy at the throat of the girl drops the girl and turns around. The guy with the bloody nose realizes what's about to happen.
    "NO, DON'T..."
    Another three shots are fired, followed by clicks as the girl continues to pull the trigger. Her eyes are closed. When she opens them, she sees the guy who called 911 standing in the back staring at the new body on the floor. She sees the guy with the bloody nose staring at her in disbelief. And she sees the body on the floor, still rasping for breath, with blood pooling on the floor around him.
    The guy with the bloody nose turns and looks at the guy who called 911, then back at the girl holding the empty revolver. The only sound in the room is heavy breathing. Except for the occasional groan from the latest body on the floor.
    "What happens now?"
    The girl drops the revolver and runs out the door. In the distance, sirens can be heard. The guy with the bloody nose turns to the guy who called 911.
    "I'm feeling kinda weird..."
    He starts to breathe heavily and crouches down to the floor. The guy who called 911 backs away. The guy with the bloody nose grunts then yells.
    "GET AWAY FROM ME I CAN'T..."
    Before he can finish his sentence he convulses and leaps after the guy who called 911, who dashes out the back door. Sprinting across the yard, he passes the girl watching the cop cars coming down the road. He yells at her to run as well, but before she has a chance she's tackled from behind by the guy with the bloody nose. He claws at her and bites into her neck as she screams. The guy who called 911 keeps running with his back to the bloody scene. The cop cars pull into the driveway and officers leap out of the vehicles. The guy who called 911 yells at them.
    "SHOOT HIM!"
    It doesn't take much convincing, considering the activity that the subject in question is currently engaged in. Many shots are fired until both the guy and the girl lay still. An officer comes up to the only remaining guy and grabs him by the shoulders, trying to calm him down. As he does so, other officers approach the scene and move into the cabin. The guy who called 911 tries to tell them to stay away and to not touch the bodies, but the officer holding his arms won't let go of him. Eventually he manages to get free and runs back to the front doorway of the cabin. He sees that there are three officers inside rolling over the bodies. He watches in horror as they touch and become contaminated. The officer who was holding him by the shoulders calls after him to come back, and tells him that he's safe. The guy looks at the officer, and at the soon-to-be-infected officers, and turns and runs away as quickly as he can.

<h4>The Andersons</h4>
<p style="white-space:pre-wrap">
    "Have a good first day of school!" their parents called as Nathaniel and Elizabeth walked out to the school bus. It was a gorgeous spring day; their mother's flowers were all blossoming in her garden and the trees and grass were strong, healthy, and colored a wonderful shade of deep emerald contrasted with the solid brown of the trunks. It was April 1st, 2108, the first day of spring, around 8 o'clock in the morning. Nathaniel and his sister walked up the steps of the bright yellow bus to the sound of chattering children and the low hum of an electric motor, saying hello to the smiling bus driver. When they were safely in their seats and the bus started moving again, Elizabeth leaned over to her brother.
    "I think that our bus driver is named Mr. Cody! I read about him in the local paper. He won some award for the kindest bus driver in the district."
    "Elizabeth, we just moved here. How could you know that already?"
    "I learned as much as I could about Manorville before we came, so that I wouldn't have to stick out like a sore thumb."
    Nathaniel just shook his head and looked out the window at the neat little houses flying by.

    They went to school from 8am to 4pm, five days a week, and had a school year lasting from April to the end of November, with a two-week-long break in the beginning of October before they had to prepare for finals, along with other week-long breaks throughout their school year. It was a simple schedule as far as classes went; they went to four classes for an hour and a half each, and had an hour long lunch to socialize and work on homework, with lengthy breaks between classes to encourage the first even more. Nathaniel had Logic and Reasoning to start the day; he had groaned at the thought back home.
    Nathaniel wove around students and robots whizzing by with messages to carry to find his classroom without too much effort, as all the classrooms had a two-digit number indicating the hall and individual door. As he walked in, he saw maybe five or six others already seated and talking to one another. He found an open seat near the back and looked around for the teacher.
    "Mr. Elliott will be in here in a minute, he probably went to the bathroom or something," said a voice behind him. He turned around and met a girl smiling at him.
    "I'm Mae, what's your name?"
    "Nathaniel. We just moved here a few days ago."
    "Oh I see, I was thinking I hadn't seen you around before. Where did you move from?"
    "We used to live farther north in a town called Willingdon, but we moved down to get away from the cold. It's not very good for you after a while."
    "I've lived here for all my life. It's not a very large town, but it's a cozy one."
    At this moment a teacher walked into the room, and the bell rang a few seconds later. Mae smiled at Nathaniel and he turned around to hear what Mr. Elliott was saying.

    When the bell rang after his second class, he went off to find Elizabeth to eat together. He found her talking with a new friend, who she introduced as Claire.
    "How have your classes been today, Elizabeth?"
    "Not very difficult. They really just introduced us to the subjects today. I'm hoping tomorrow we can get to some real learning."
    "I'm sure you are," Nathaniel responded, looking around.
    "Who're you looking for?" Elizabeth demanded.
    "No one, just looking."
    "Sure. Have you met anyone today?"
    "Yeah just one person. Look, there she is!" he said, pointing.
    Elizabeth gave him a sly look. "What's her name?"
    "Mae," Nathaniel replied, giving her a little wave in hopes Mae would notice him.
    "Do you know who she is?"
    "What do you mean, do I know who she is?" Nathaniel asked, irritated that she hadn't seen him wave.
    "She's the mayor's daughter! I found that out when I was looking up the mayor and his family so I'd know," she confided to Claire. "She'd be a boring one to date though. You can't get into any trouble with someone like that."
    "Elizabeth! You're too young to be saying things like that, and I never said anything about dating her, I've barely talked to her." Elizabeth and Claire giggled.
    Nathaniel scowled and ate the rest of his lunch in silence.

    When Nathaniel and Elizabeth got off the bus that afternoon, they were greeted by their mother, who asked them if their first day went okay. "Nathaniel's already got his eyes set on someone, and I made a friend!" Elizabeth said. Nathaniel ignored his sister's statement and said, "I made a friend named Carter. He plays football just like I do." Their mother smiled at them. "Sounds like you had an exciting day! Let's find something to eat before supper."
    They went inside and stepped around a few boxes to get to the kitchen, as a cleaning robot whisked around the floor trying to polish the obstacles. "He's been a little confused today," the children's mother said as she prepared something for them to snack on. "Mother," Elizabeth said. "Today one of my friends was telling me that all of our money actually goes to the government and we don't get any of it. Is that true?"
    "Yes, sweetie. That's one thing you'll learn about this year. That way every family gets what they need and there's no poverty, like there used to be a hundred years ago. That's why you learn about the Human War in school; it was a result of an old idea called capitalism, where the rich would get richer and the poor would get poorer. The way it is now, everyone gets what they need, and instead of your efforts only advancing yourself, you advance the whole society and economy with your hard work. It really is much better for everyone." 
    Nathaniel left the kitchen to go to his room. As he was going up the stairs, a cat came flying down and he had to jump out of the way. As he did, Nathaniel landed on the edge of a stair and toppled back, trying to break his fall with his arm. Nathaniel yelled in pain as he crashed to the ground, his arm catching on the sharp edge of a corner table on the way down. His mother and sister came running into the room and gasped. Nathaniel was sitting on the floor, holding his arm. There was a gash from his palm, down his wrist, to his forearm. Out of the tear protruded wires, gears, and cables. 
    "I can't feel my hand!" he yelled.
    "Oh my gosh!" his mother exclaimed. "I'll take you to the doctor right away. He should be able to fix your arm right up. You'll be as good as new. Just let me find my keys."
