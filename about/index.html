I was born in 2004, and this site is my own original content.
I am from the southern Appalachian Mountains, but I try to not sound too much like a hillbilly.

I would like to note that I have absolutely no freakin idea what I'm doing.
I do not enjoy writing. I've always hated writing classes.
I have read a lot of books, and I give them all the credit for any ability I have.
I have never had a teacher who liked my writing style or product. 
I have always considered writing a weakness of mine.
I simply don't have another way to get my thoughts out somewhere that others may see them.

To those who have contributed to the $230 I have received so far: thank you, sincerely. 
As a broke and married college student, it's really a blessing and helps me keep writing.

Also, I hate coding websites.
