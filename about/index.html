I was born in 2004, and this site is my own original content.
I'm from the Appalachian Mountains, but I try not to sound too much like a hillbilly.

I would like to note that I have absolutely no freakin idea what I'm doing.
I do not particularly enjoy writing. I've never tried to improve, and I've always hated writing classes.
I have read an unreasonable number of books, and I give them all the credit for any ability I have.
I've never had a teacher who liked my writing style or (often) product. I've always considered it a weakness of mine.
But I simply don't have another way to get my thoughts out somewhere that others might see them.

Help fund my dream to find, buy, restore, and upgrade a '95 Impreza ($140 of the way there lol):

Also I hate coding websites.
